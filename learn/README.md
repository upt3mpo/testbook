# 🎓 Testbook Learning Path

**A structured, self-guided journey to master automation testing**

Welcome! This learning path transforms the Testbook project into your personal testing bootcamp. Follow these 5 stages in order to build real-world automation testing skills that employers are actively seeking.

---

## 🗺️ How This Works

Unlike traditional tutorials, you'll learn by **exploring real, working test code**. Each stage:

1. **Links to actual test files** in the codebase
2. **Explains what to look for** and why it matters
3. **Provides reflection questions** to deepen understanding
4. **Builds toward portfolio-ready artifacts**

**Time Commitment:** 12-18 hours total (self-paced)

---

## 📊 The 5 Stages

### 🧪 Stage 1: Unit Tests

**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**What you'll learn:** Test individual functions in isolation

Unit tests are fast, focused tests that verify single functions work correctly. You'll learn fixtures, mocking, and the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.

👉 [Start Stage 1](stage_1_unit/README.md)

---

### 🧱 Stage 2: Integration Tests

**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**What you'll learn:** Test how components work together

Integration tests verify API endpoints, database operations, and multi-component workflows. You'll learn HTTP testing, database fixtures, and test organization.

👉 [Start Stage 2](stage_2_integration/README.md)

---

### 🌐 Stage 3: API & E2E Testing

**Duration:** 4-5 hours
**What you'll learn:** Test complete user workflows and contracts

End-to-end tests simulate real user behavior in a browser. API tests validate contracts and external integrations. You'll learn Playwright, contract testing, and visual testing.

👉 [Start Stage 3](stage_3_api_e2e/README.md)

---

### 🚀 Stage 4: Performance & Security

**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**What you'll learn:** Test scalability and protect against vulnerabilities

Performance tests measure speed and capacity. Security tests find vulnerabilities. You'll learn k6, rate limiting, input validation, and security best practices.

👉 [Start Stage 4](stage_4_performance_security/README.md)

---

### 🎓 Stage 5: Job-Ready Capstone

**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**What you'll build:** Portfolio-ready test suite + documentation

Build your own test suite from scratch, create visual artifacts, and package everything for job applications. You'll learn portfolio presentation, resume bullets, and interview prep.

👉 [Start Stage 5](stage_5_capstone/README.md)

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By completing all 5 stages, you will be able to:

✅ Write unit, integration, and E2E tests professionally
✅ Use pytest, Playwright, and k6 effectively
✅ Test APIs, UIs, databases, and security
✅ Build test automation frameworks from scratch
✅ Present your work confidently in interviews
✅ Understand QA engineering workflows

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting Stage 1:

- ✅ Testbook installed and running ([QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md))
- ✅ Basic Python knowledge (functions, classes, imports)
- ✅ Basic JavaScript knowledge (optional for E2E)
- ✅ Terminal/command line familiarity
- ✅ Code editor (VS Code recommended)

---

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Ensure Testbook is running
cd testbook
./start-dev.sh  # macOS/Linux
start-dev.bat   # Windows

# 2. Verify it's working
# Open http://localhost:3000

# 3. Start learning!
# Open learn/stage_1_unit/README.md
```

### Your Learning Journey

1. **Read** the stage README to understand goals
2. **Explore** the linked test files (don't just skim!)
3. **Run** the tests and observe the output
4. **Experiment** by modifying tests
5. **Reflect** using the reflection questions
6. **Move forward** when you feel confident

---

## 💡 How to Use This Path

### ✅ DO

- **Go in order** - Each stage builds on previous knowledge
- **Type code yourself** - Don't copy-paste; typing builds muscle memory
- **Break things** - Modify tests, see what fails, fix them
- **Take notes** - Document "aha!" moments
- **Ask "why?"** - Understand the reasoning behind patterns
- **Reflect deeply** - Answer reflection questions thoughtfully

### ❌ DON'T

- Skip stages or rush through
- Just read code without running it
- Ignore failing tests
- Move forward if confused
- Copy-paste without understanding

## 🔄 Relationship to Labs

**What's the difference between `/learn/` and `/labs/`?**

| Path | Purpose | Structure | Best For |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **`/learn/`** | Structured curriculum | Sequential stages | Self-guided mastery |
| **`/labs/`** | Hands-on exercises | Individual workshops | Practicing specific skills |

**Use them together:**

1. Follow `/learn/` stages for overall progression
2. Use `/labs/` exercises to practice specific concepts
3. Come back to `/learn/` to see how it all connects

---

## 📞 Getting Help
