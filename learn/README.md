<h2 id="testing-pyramid">🏗️ The Testing Pyramid</h2>

Both Python and JavaScript tracks follow the same testing pyramid, but with different tools:

```text
                ▲
               /_\  ← Manual / Exploratory Testing
              /   \
             / E2E \  ← Playwright (JS / Python)
            /_______\
           /         \
          / Component \  ← Vitest + RTL (JS only)
         /_____________\
        /               \
       /  Integration    \  ← API / Component tests
      /___________________\

- ✅ Basic Python knowledge (functions, classes, imports)
- ✅ Basic JavaScript knowledge (optional for E2E)
- ✅ Terminal/command line familiarity
- ✅ Code editor (VS Code recommended)

---

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Ensure Testbook is running
cd testbook
./start-dev.sh  # macOS/Linux
start-dev.bat   # Windows

# 2. Verify it's working
# Open http://localhost:3000

# 3. Start learning!
# Open learn/stage_1_unit/README.md
```

### Your Learning Journey

1. **Read** the stage README to understand goals
2. **Explore** the linked test files (don't just skim!)
3. **Run** the tests and observe the output
4. **Experiment** by modifying tests
5. **Reflect** using the reflection questions
6. **Move forward** when you feel confident

---

## 💡 How to Use This Path

### ✅ DO

- **Go in order** - Each stage builds on previous knowledge
- **Type code yourself** - Don't copy-paste; typing builds muscle memory
- **Break things** - Modify tests, see what fails, fix them
- **Take notes** - Document "aha!" moments
- **Ask "why?"** - Understand the reasoning behind patterns
- **Reflect deeply** - Answer reflection questions thoughtfully

### ❌ DON'T

- Skip stages or rush through
- Just read code without running it
- Ignore failing tests
- Move forward if confused
- Copy-paste without understanding
