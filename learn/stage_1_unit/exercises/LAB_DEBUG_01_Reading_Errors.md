ok# üêõ Lab DEBUG-01: Reading Error Messages

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Prerequisites:** Lab 1 completed

---

## üéØ What You'll Learn

By the end of this lab, you will:

- Read and understand pytest error messages
- Identify the exact line where tests fail
- Understand assertion errors
- Extract useful information from stack traces
- Know what to look for when debugging

**Important:** This lab is about **learning to read errors**, not avoiding them. Errors are your friends - they tell you exactly what's wrong!

---

## üìã Why This Matters

**Reality Check:**

- 80% of your testing time will be debugging
- Error messages tell you EXACTLY what's wrong
- Learning to read errors makes you 10x faster
- Professional testers are expert error readers

**What students say:**

- ‚ùå "I got an error, I don't know what to do"
- ‚úÖ "The error says X is None on line 45, let me check that"

## üîç Anatomy of an Error Message

### Example 1: Simple Assertion Error

**Let's create a failing test to learn from:**

```python
# Create: backend/tests/test_learn_errors.py

def test_simple_math():
    """A test that will fail."""
    result = 2 + 2
    assert result == 5  # Wrong answer!
```

**Run it:**

```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/test_learn_errors.py::test_simple_math -v
```

**You'll see:**

```text
============================ FAILURES =============================
__________________ test_simple_math ___________________

    def test_simple_math():
        """A test that will fail."""
        result = 2 + 2
>       assert result == 5
E       AssertionError: assert 4 == 5

tests/test_learn_errors.py:4: AssertionError
========================= short test summary info =================
FAILED tests/test_learn_errors.py::test_simple_math - AssertionError: assert 4 == 5
```

**Let's break this down:**

```text
============================ FAILURES =============================
```

**Meaning:** The failures section starts here

```text
__________________ test_simple_math ___________________
```

**Meaning:** This is the name of the test that failed

```text
    def test_simple_math():
        """A test that will fail."""
        result = 2 + 2
>       assert result == 5
```

**Meaning:** Shows the code around the failure. The `>` arrow points to the EXACT line that failed

```text
E       AssertionError: assert 4 == 5
```

**Meaning:**

- `E` means "Error"
- `AssertionError` is the error type
- `assert 4 == 5` shows what was asserted
- It's saying: "You said 4 equals 5, but it doesn't!"

```text
tests/test_learn_errors.py:4: AssertionError
```

**Meaning:**

- File: `tests/test_learn_errors.py`
- Line: `4`
- Error type: `AssertionError`

```text
FAILED tests/test_learn_errors.py::test_simple_math - AssertionError: assert 4 == 5
```

**Meaning:** Summary line showing what failed and why

## üìö Step-by-Step Error Reading Practice

### Exercise 1: Variable Comparison

**Create this test:**

```python
def test_string_comparison():
    """Practice reading string comparison errors."""
    expected = "Hello World"
    actual = "Hello world"  # Note: lowercase 'w'
    assert expected == actual
```

**Run it:**

```bash
pytest tests/test_learn_errors.py::test_string_comparison -v
```

**Questions to answer:**

1. What line number failed?
2. What was the expected value?
3. What was the actual value?
4. What's different between them?

<details>
<summary>Click to see answers</summary>

1. Line depends on where you put it in the file
2. Expected: "Hello World" (capital W)
3. Actual: "Hello world" (lowercase w)
4. The 'W' vs 'w'

**The Error Shows:**

```text
E       AssertionError: assert 'Hello World' == 'Hello world'
E         - Hello world
E         + Hello World
E         ?       ^
```

The `^` points to the exact difference!

</details>

### Exercise 2: Type Errors

**Create this test:**

```python
def test_type_mismatch():
    """Practice reading type errors."""
    result = "42"  # String
    assert result == 42  # Integer
```

**Run it and answer:**

1. What types are being compared?
2. Why doesn't Python automatically convert them?
3. How would you fix this?

<details>
<summary>Click to see answers</summary>

1. String "42" vs Integer 42
2. Python is strict about types in comparisons
3. Either: `assert result == "42"` or `assert int(result) == 42`

**The Error Shows:**

```text
E       AssertionError: assert '42' == 42
```

The quotes around '42' tell you it's a string!

</details>

---

### Exercise 3: None vs Value

**Create this test:**

```python
def test_none_value():
    """Practice reading None errors."""
    value = None
    assert value == "something"
```

**Run it and answer:**

1. What is `value`?
2. What did we expect?
3. Why might this happen in real code?

<details>
<summary>Click to see answers</summary>

1. `value` is `None`
2. We expected `"something"`
3. Common scenarios:
   - Function forgot to return
   - Database query found nothing
   - API returned null
   - Variable not initialized

**The Error Shows:**

```text
E       AssertionError: assert None == 'something'
```

</details>

---

### Exercise 4: List/Collection Errors

**Create this test:**

```python
def test_list_length():
    """Practice reading collection errors."""
    items = ["apple", "banana"]
    assert len(items) == 3
```

**Run it and answer:**

1. How many items are in the list?
2. How many did we expect?
3. How can you see what's actually in the list?

<details>
<summary>Click to see answers</summary>

1. 2 items
2. Expected 3 items
3. Add `print(items)` before the assert, run with `pytest -s`

**The Error Shows:**

```text
E       AssertionError: assert 2 == 3
E        +  where 2 = len(['apple', 'banana'])
```

See how it shows the actual list contents!

</details>

## üéì Reading Real Testbook Errors

### Exercise 5: API Error

**Create this test:**

```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from main import app

def test_api_error():
    """Practice reading API errors."""
    client = TestClient(app)
    response = client.get("/api/nonexistent")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

**Run it:**

```bash
pytest tests/test_learn_errors.py::test_api_error -v
```

**What you'll see:**

```text
E       AssertionError: assert 404 == 200
E        +  where 404 = <Response [404]>.status_code
```

**Questions:**

1. What status code did we get?
2. What does 404 mean?
3. Why did we get 404?

<details>
<summary>Click to see answers</summary>

1. Got 404
2. 404 means "Not Found"
3. The endpoint `/api/nonexistent` doesn't exist!

**Real Scenario:** This is what happens when:

- You mistyped the endpoint URL
- The endpoint hasn't been created yet
- The route is under a different prefix

</details>

---

### Exercise 6: Import Error

**Create this test:**

```python
def test_import_error():
    """Practice reading import errors."""
    from nonexistent_module import something
    assert something is not None
```

**Run it - it will fail differently!**

**You'll see:**

```text
E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nonexistent_module'
```

**Questions:**

1. What's different about this error?
2. Why did the test fail before running?
3. How would you fix this?

<details>
<summary>Click to see answers</summary>

1. The test failed during import, not during execution
2. Python couldn't even load the test because the import failed
3. Either:
   - Install the module: `pip install module-name`
   - Fix the import name
   - Remove the import if not needed

</details>

## üî¨ Advanced Error Reading

### Exercise 7: Stack Trace

**Create this test with multiple function calls:**

```python
def helper_function(value):
    """A helper that will cause an error."""
    return value.upper()  # Will fail if value is not a string

def another_helper(data):
    """Another level of function calls."""
    return helper_function(data)

def test_stack_trace():
    """Practice reading stack traces."""
    result = another_helper(42)  # Passing a number, not a string!
    assert result == "42"
```

**Run it:**

```bash
pytest tests/test_learn_errors.py::test_stack_trace -v
```

**You'll see a STACK TRACE:**

```text
tests/test_learn_errors.py:X: in test_stack_trace
    result = another_helper(42)
tests/test_learn_errors.py:Y: in another_helper
    return helper_function(data)
tests/test_learn_errors.py:Z: in helper_function
    return value.upper()
E   AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'upper'
```

**Reading the Stack Trace (bottom to top):**

1. **Bottom (where error happened):**

   ```text
   return value.upper()
   E   AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'upper'
   ```

   The actual error: tried to call `.upper()` on an integer

2. **Middle (how we got there):**

   ```text
   return helper_function(data)
   ```

   `another_helper` called `helper_function`

3. **Top (where it started):**

   ```text
   result = another_helper(42)
   ```

   We passed `42` (an integer) to `another_helper`

**The Chain:**

```text
test_stack_trace (called with 42)
    ‚Üì
another_helper (received 42)
    ‚Üì
helper_function (tried to call 42.upper())
    ‚Üì
‚ùå ERROR: integers don't have .upper()
```

## üí™ Challenge Exercises

**Create tests that produce these errors, then fix them:**

### Challenge 1: Index Error

```python
def test_challenge_index():
    """Create a test that causes IndexError."""
    # TODO: Write code that tries to access
    # an index that doesn't exist
    pass
```

**Hint:** Try accessing `items[10]` when list only has 3 items

---

### Challenge 2: Key Error

```python
def test_challenge_key():
    """Create a test that causes KeyError."""
    # TODO: Write code that tries to access
    # a dictionary key that doesn't exist
    pass
```

**Hint:** Try accessing `data["nonexistent"]`

---

### Challenge 3: Attribute Error

```python
def test_challenge_attribute():
    """Create a test that causes AttributeError."""
    # TODO: Write code that tries to access
    # an attribute that doesn't exist
    pass
```

**Hint:** Try calling a method that doesn't exist on an object

## üìä Error Reading Checklist

When you see an error, check:

- [ ] **What is the test name?** - Which test failed
- [ ] **What line failed?** - Look for the `>` arrow
- [ ] **What was expected?** - After `==` in assert
- [ ] **What was actual?** - Before `==` in assert
- [ ] **What is the error type?** - AssertionError, AttributeError, etc.
- [ ] **Is there a stack trace?** - Multiple function calls shown
- [ ] **What do the diffs show?** - The `+` and `-` lines
- [ ] **Are there helpful hints?** - Like "where X = ..."

---

## üö® Common Errors and What They Mean

### AssertionError

```text
E   AssertionError: assert 4 == 5
```

**Means:** Your assertion is wrong. Expected one thing, got another.
**Fix:** Check your expected value or your code logic.

---

### AttributeError

```text
E   AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'email'
```

**Means:** Trying to access `.email` on something that's `None`.
**Fix:** Check why the value is `None`. Did a function forget to return?

---

### TypeError

```text
E   TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

**Means:** Trying to do an operation with incompatible types.
**Fix:** Convert types: `str(42) + "text"` or `42 + int("42")`

---

### KeyError

```text
E   KeyError: 'email'
```

**Means:** Trying to access a dictionary key that doesn't exist.
**Fix:** Check spelling, or use `.get('email')` instead of `['email']`

---

### IndexError

```text
E   IndexError: list index out of range
```

**Means:** Trying to access index that doesn't exist.
**Fix:** Check list length first, or use try/except.

---

### ModuleNotFoundError

```text
E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytest'
```

**Means:** Python can't find the module.
**Fix:** `pip install pytest` or activate virtualenv.
