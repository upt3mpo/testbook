# Stage 4 Quiz Answers

## Performance & Security Testing Quiz Answers

### 1. What's the main purpose of performance testing?

**Answer: B) To ensure the app works under load**

- Performance testing verifies the app works under expected load
- It identifies bottlenecks and performance issues
- It ensures the app can handle real-world usage
- It's not just about finding bugs or testing individual functions

### 2. What does p95 response time mean?

**Answer: B) 95% of requests are faster than this time**

- p95 means 95th percentile
- 95% of requests complete in this time or faster
- It's more important than average because it shows worst-case performance
- It helps identify performance outliers

### 3. What is the OWASP Top 10?

**Answer: A) The 10 most common web vulnerabilities**

- OWASP Top 10 lists the most critical web application security risks
- It's updated regularly based on real-world data
- It helps prioritize security testing efforts
- It's not about testing tools or frameworks

### 4. Why is security testing important?

**Answer: B) It protects against attacks and data breaches**

- Security testing identifies vulnerabilities before attackers do
- It protects user data and company reputation
- It's required for compliance in many industries
- It's not about speed, user experience, or development time

### 5. What's the difference between load testing and stress testing?

**Answer: B) Load testing checks normal load, stress testing checks breaking point**

- Load testing verifies performance under expected load
- Stress testing finds the breaking point of the system
- Both are important for understanding system limits
- The difference is in the load level, not speed or users

## How Did You Do?

- **5/5:** Excellent! You understand performance and security testing
- **4/5:** Very good! You're ready for Stage 5
- **3/5:** Good! Review the concepts you missed
- **2/5 or less:** Consider reviewing Stage 4 materials before moving on

## Need More Practice?

- Re-read the [Stage 4 README](../stage_4_performance_security/README.md)
- Complete the [Stage 4 exercises](../stage_4_performance_security/exercises/)
- Try the [Performance Testing Guide](../../docs/guides/PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md)
- Practice with [Security Testing Guide](../../docs/guides/SECURITY_TESTING.md)

## Ready for Stage 5?

If you got 3/5 or better, you're ready to move on to [Stage 5: Capstone](../stage_5_capstone/README.md)!
