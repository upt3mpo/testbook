---

## üèóÔ∏è Building Your Suite

### Step 1: Plan Your Tests

Before writing code, plan your test strategy:

**Create a test plan document:**

```markdown
# Test Plan: [Feature Name]

## Feature Overview
[Describe what the feature does]

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests (Fast, isolated)
- [ ] Test 1: ...
- [ ] Test 2: ...

### Integration Tests (API endpoints)
- [ ] Test 1: ...
- [ ] Test 2: ...

### E2E Tests (User workflows)
- [ ] Test 1: ...
- [ ] Test 2: ...

### Security Tests
- [ ] Test 1: ...
- [ ] Test 2: ...

## Test Data Requirements
- User accounts: ...
- Sample data: ...

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass
- Coverage > 80%
- All endpoints tested
- Security verified
```

### Step 2: Write Unit Tests

Create `test_unit_<feature>.py`:

```python
import pytest
from your_feature import some_function

@pytest.mark.unit
class TestFeatureLogic:
    """Unit tests for [feature] business logic."""

    def test_basic_functionality(self):
        """Verify basic function works correctly."""
        # Arrange
        input_data = "test"

        # Act
        result = some_function(input_data)

        # Assert
        assert result is not None

    def test_edge_case(self):
        """Verify handling of edge cases."""
        # Test with empty input, None, etc.
        pass
```

### Step 3: Write Integration Tests

Create `test_api_<feature>.py`:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.api
class TestFeatureAPI:
    """Integration tests for [feature] API endpoints."""

    def test_create_resource(self, client, auth_headers):
        """Test creating a new resource."""
        # Arrange
        payload = {"data": "test"}

        # Act
        response = client.post("/feature", json=payload, headers=auth_headers)

        # Assert
        assert response.status_code == 201
        assert "id" in response.json()

    def test_unauthorized_access(self, client):
        """Verify authentication is required."""
        response = client.post("/feature", json={})
        assert response.status_code == 401
```

### Step 4: Write E2E Tests

Create `test_e2e_<feature>.py`:

```python
import pytest
from playwright.async_api import expect

@pytest.mark.e2e
async def test_user_can_use_feature(page, login):
    """End-to-end test of complete user workflow."""
    # Navigate to feature
    await page.goto("http://localhost:3000/feature")

    # Interact with UI
    await page.fill("#input", "test data")
    await page.click("#submit")

    # Verify result
    await expect(page.locator(".success-message")).to_be_visible()
```

### Step 5: Add Security Tests

```python
@pytest.mark.security
def test_feature_security(client, auth_headers):
    """Verify security measures in feature."""
    # Test SQL injection
    malicious_input = "'; DROP TABLE--"
    response = client.post("/feature",
        json={"data": malicious_input},
        headers=auth_headers
    )
    assert response.status_code in [400, 422]
```

### Step 6: Run and Document Results

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=your_feature --cov-report=html

# Run E2E tests with video
VIDEO_ON_FAILURE=true HEADLESS=false pytest test_e2e_<feature>.py

# Generate report
pytest --html=report.html
```

---

## üì∏ Creating Portfolio Artifacts

### Artifact 1: Test Coverage Report

```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov --cov-report=html

# Screenshot the coverage report
# Open htmlcov/index.html and capture screenshot
```

**Include in portfolio:**

- Overall coverage percentage
- File-by-file coverage
- Highlighted: "Achieved 85% test coverage"

### Artifact 2: Test Execution Video

```bash
# Run E2E test with recording
VIDEO_ON_FAILURE=true HEADLESS=false pytest tests/test_e2e_feature.py

# Result: video of test running
```

**Include in portfolio:**

- 30-60 second clip
- Shows test in action
- Voiceover explaining what's being tested (optional)

### Artifact 3: Test Report

Generate professional test report:

```bash
pytest --html=test-report.html --self-contained-html
```

**Include in portfolio:**

- Pass/fail statistics
- Test execution time
- Any failures and how you fixed them

### Artifact 4: Test Documentation

Create `TESTING.md` for your feature:

````markdown
# Testing Documentation: [Feature Name]

## Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests:** 15 tests, 100% function coverage
- **Integration Tests:** 12 tests, all endpoints covered
- **E2E Tests:** 5 tests, critical paths verified
- **Security Tests:** 3 tests, OWASP Top 10 addressed

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest -v

# Run specific suite
pytest -m unit
pytest -m integration
pytest -m e2e
```

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests
Focus on business logic validation...

### Integration Tests
Verify API contracts and data flow...

### E2E Tests
Confirm user workflows work end-to-end...

## Notable Test Cases

### Test: Unauthorized Access Prevention
**Why it matters:** Prevents users from accessing others' data
**How it works:** Attempts to access resource with wrong credentials
**Result:** Returns 403 Forbidden

## Continuous Improvement

Areas for future testing:
- Performance testing with k6
- Accessibility testing
- Cross-browser E2E tests

## üé§ Interview Preparation

### Common QA Interview Questions

Practice answering these with examples from your work:

#### Technical Questions

**Q: "Explain the difference between unit, integration, and E2E tests."**
*Use the test pyramid. Give examples from Testbook.*

**Q: "How do you decide what to test?"**
*Talk about risk-based testing, critical paths, test strategy.*

**Q: "Walk me through how you'd test [feature]."**
*Show your test plan from this capstone.*

**Q: "How do you handle flaky tests?"**
*Discuss waits, retries, isolation, debugging techniques.*

**Q: "What's your approach to security testing?"**
*Reference OWASP Top 10, your security tests.*

#### Behavioral Questions

**Q: "Tell me about a bug you found."**
*Prepare story: What was it? How'd you find it? Impact? How'd you document it?*

**Q: "Describe a time you had to learn a new testing tool."**
*Your Testbook journey! Playwright, pytest, k6.*

**Q: "How do you prioritize testing when time is limited?"**
*Risk-based testing, smoke tests, critical paths.*

### Show Your Work

**Bring to interviews:**

1. **Laptop with code ready** - Demo your tests running
2. **Coverage report screenshot** - Visual proof
3. **Test execution video** - Show E2E tests in action
4. **TESTING.md document** - Professional documentation
5. **GitHub repo link** - Clean, public portfolio

**Practice this demo:**
"Here's a test I wrote for [feature]. Let me show you how it runs..."
[Run test, explain each step, show passing result]
