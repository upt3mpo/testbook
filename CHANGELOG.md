## [Unreleased]

_Future updates will be documented here._

---

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-29 - "Repo Hygiene, Versions, Faster CI"

### Added

- `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes` for consistent formatting and line endings
- `.python-version` (3.12), `.nvmrc` (20), and Node `engines` in `frontend/` and `tests/`
- Dependabot config for Actions, npm (frontend/tests), and pip (backend)
- Full Checks workflow (manual) to run pre-commit + backend + frontend in one place

### Changed

- Organized `.gitignore`; ensured editor and test artifacts are ignored
- Updated PR and Issue templates to current flows; added repo hygiene checks
- CI now runs Python 3.12 across backend/e2e/api; Node 20 across frontend/tests
- Reduced CI artifact retention (coverage 7d; E2E report 7d; videos 3d)
- Enabled manual triggers on key workflows; added pre-commit workflow
- Frontend: Upgraded Vitest stack to address esbuild advisory — `vitest` 4.x, `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4.x, `@vitest/ui` 4.x; kept Vite 6.x and updated `@vitejs/plugin-react` to latest compatible. Test config remains `jsdom` with existing setup files. `npm audit` shows 0 vulnerabilities.
- Backend: Bumped dependencies (SQLAlchemy 2.0.44, Pydantic 2.12.x, Pydantic Settings 2.11.x, python-jose 3.5.x, python-multipart 0.0.20, psycopg 3.2.12, requests 2.32.5, httpx 0.28.x, pytest 8.4.x, pytest-xdist 3.8.x, flake8 7.3.x, pre-commit 4.3.x). All backend tests pass (180), minor deprecation warning noted from Starlette/multipart.

### Removed

- Tracked artifacts removed
- Markdown link-check job (kept markdownlint) to cut CI noise
- Codecov upload step (coverage artifacts remain available)

### Documentation

- README clarified versions (Python 3.12, Node 20) and pointed to `.python-version`/`.nvmrc`
- Backend tests docs updated to generate fresh coverage vs static snapshot
