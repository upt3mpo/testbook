- Section 10: Performance testing (K6)
- Section 11: Security testing (OWASP)
- Section 12: CI/CD & Automation (GitHub Actions for both stacks)

**3 Advanced Guides:**
- Section 8: Advanced E2E Patterns (8-10 hours, dual-stack)
- Testing Comparison: Python vs JavaScript (45 min, side-by-side)
- CI/CD for E2E Testing (3-4 hours, production workflows)

### Learning Paths

**4 Validated Learning Personas:**
- **Path A-B:** Manual QA & Developers (50-60 hours, 25-35 hours)
- **Path C:** Complete Beginners (80-100 hours)
- **Path D:** Experienced SDETs (10-15 hours)
- **Path H:** Hybrid Track - Python backend + JavaScript frontend (30-40 hours) ‚≠ê **Most Common**

**3 Quick-Decision Scenarios:**
- Python-Only: Backend/API testing focus
- Hybrid (Recommended!): Python backend + React frontend
- Full-Stack: Complete mastery in both languages

### Technical Implementation

- JWT authentication
- Test factories and fixtures

**Frontend (React/Vite):**
- 30 passing tests (Vitest)
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Contract tests with OpenAPI validation
- Accessibility tests with axe-core
- MSW for API mocking
- Modern React patterns

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- Playwright for E2E (Python & JavaScript)
- K6 for performance testing
