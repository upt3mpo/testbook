## [Unreleased]

_Future updates will be documented here._

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-10 - "Test quality, accessibility, and application hardening"

### Added

- Page Object Model adopted consistently across both E2E language tracks; hard-coded waits replaced with auto-waiting assertions
- Visual regression testing infrastructure: a scheduled CI workflow and a Playwright screenshot suite covering login, feed, and post detail
- OWASP Top 10 gap scaffolding (`tests/security/test_owasp_gaps.py`) documenting the three categories this suite doesn't yet cover and what a real implementation would check
- File upload validation now checks actual file content against each image format's signature, not just the extension
- `docs/reference/SECURITY_NOTES.md`, consolidating JWT, CORS, and upload-security decisions in one place
- `docs/reference/GLOSSARY.md` with plain-language definitions for recurring testing terms
- Entry criteria added to Stages 2-4 of the learning path (Stage 5 already had them), sourced from each stage's own success-criteria checklist
- `timeout-minutes` set on every CI job across all workflows

### Changed

- Backend models migrated to SQLAlchemy 2.0's `Mapped[]`/`mapped_column()` style; fully backward-compatible at the SQL and runtime level and now type-checkable end to end
- Backend linting switched from isort/Flake8 to Ruff, consistent between local pre-commit hooks and CI (previously pre-commit ran Ruff while CI ran isort/Flake8 separately)
- mypy added as a tracked backend dependency; the backend tree passes clean
- Frontend statement coverage raised from 41% to 83%
- Stage 5 capstone redesigned around one integrated ticket spanning all four prior stages instead of four independent single-stage tasks
- CORS `allow_credentials` disabled: it was combined with a wildcard origin, and the app authenticates with bearer tokens only, never cookies
- The learning path's self-assessment now routes students by their actual track choice instead of defaulting everyone toward Python

### Fixed

- 15 accessibility violations found via a full axe-core scan across all 6 application pages (missing `<main>` landmarks, missing page-level headings) and fixed; the existing accessibility test suite's tag scope was widened so this class of regression fails CI going forward
- Rate-limit security tests now check the server's actual runtime mode instead of the invoking shell's environment variable, fixing two tests that could silently skip or run against the wrong expectation
- `start-dev.sh` and `start-dev.bat` now exit with a clear error on a port conflict instead of reporting success against a server that failed to start
- Devcontainer: Playwright's Chromium system dependencies are now installed at build time, fixing headless browser launches inside the dev container
- Docker: production startup no longer silently creates an empty database directory when the database file doesn't exist yet

### Documentation

- Seed credential exposure warning added to README and the Quick Start guide
- Mutation testing section now shows a real worked example (`mutmut` against `backend/auth.py`) instead of a hypothetical one

### Validation

- Backend: 203 passed, 1 skipped, 85.42% statement coverage
- Frontend: 144 passed, 2 skipped, 83.36% statement / 84.08% line coverage
- E2E (JavaScript): 59 passed
- E2E (Python): 60 passed
- Security: 18 passed, 11 skipped, 0 failed
- Accessibility (axe-core, full ruleset): 0 violations across all 6 pages

---

## [1.3.2] - 2025-10-29 - "Node 24 baseline + majors"

### Added

- Node 24 LTS baseline across repo: engines set in `frontend/` and `tests/`, CI matrices, and devcontainer install

### Changed

- Frontend: ESLint 9 flat config, Vite 7, React 19, React Router 7 confirmed; build and tests green
- Backend: Dependency majors aligned with FastAPI/Starlette stack
  - uvicorn 0.38.0, pillow 12.x, schemathesis 4.x, pytest-asyncio 1.x, pytest-cov 7.x
  - Kept bcrypt at 4.0.1 for passlib compatibility (bcrypt 5.x caused hashing errors with long inputs)
- Tests workspace: Playwright 1.56.x, LHCI 0.15.x verified
- CI: Node 24 and Python 3.13 used across workflows

### Documentation

- Updated version references to Node 24 in `.devcontainer/README.md`, `README.md`, and contributing docs

### Validation

- Backend unit+integration: 180 passed
- Frontend unit+a11y: 40 passed; Vite build successful
- E2E: Covered in CI workflows; local sanity checks for tool versions

---

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-29 - "Repo Hygiene, Versions, Faster CI"

### Added

- `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes` for consistent formatting and line endings
- `.python-version` (3.12), `.nvmrc` (20), and Node `engines` in `frontend/` and `tests/`
- Dependabot config for Actions, npm (frontend/tests), and pip (backend)
- Full Checks workflow (manual) to run pre-commit + backend + frontend in one place

### Changed

- Organized `.gitignore`; ensured editor and test artifacts are ignored
- Updated PR and Issue templates to current flows; added repo hygiene checks
- CI now runs Python 3.12 across backend/e2e/api; Node 20 across frontend/tests
- Reduced CI artifact retention (coverage 7d; E2E report 7d; videos 3d)
- Enabled manual triggers on key workflows; added pre-commit workflow
- Frontend: Upgraded Vitest stack to address esbuild advisory — `vitest` 4.x, `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4.x, `@vitest/ui` 4.x; kept Vite 6.x and updated `@vitejs/plugin-react` to latest compatible. Test config remains `jsdom` with existing setup files. `npm audit` shows 0 vulnerabilities.
- Backend: Bumped dependencies (SQLAlchemy 2.0.44, Pydantic 2.12.x, Pydantic Settings 2.11.x, python-jose 3.5.x, python-multipart 0.0.20, psycopg 3.2.12, requests 2.32.5, httpx 0.28.x, pytest 8.4.x, pytest-xdist 3.8.x, flake8 7.3.x, pre-commit 4.3.x). All backend tests pass (180), minor deprecation warning noted from Starlette/multipart.

### Removed

- Tracked artifacts removed
- Markdown link-check job (kept markdownlint) to cut CI noise
- Codecov upload step (coverage artifacts remain available)

### Documentation

- README clarified versions (Python 3.12, Node 20) and pointed to `.python-version`/`.nvmrc`
- Backend tests docs updated to generate fresh coverage vs static snapshot
