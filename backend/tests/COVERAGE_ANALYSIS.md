## 📚 Teaching Opportunities

### Use Coverage Gaps as Learning Exercises

**Practice Exercise: "Improve Coverage"**

**Challenge:**

> "The dev.py router had 38% coverage. Practice improving it:
>
> 1. Run coverage: `pytest --cov=routers.dev --cov-report=term-missing`
> 2. Identify untested lines
> 3. Write tests to cover test mode guards
> 4. Test both blocked and allowed scenarios
> 5. Document: Your tests + coverage report"

**Reference Solution:**

See `backend/tests/integration/test_api_dev.py` for a complete test suite that:

- Tests security guards (TESTING=true requirement)
- Covers all dev endpoints
- Tests edge cases (case-insensitive env vars)
- Models professional security testing

**What You'll Learn:**

- How to test security controls
- Testing environment-based features
- Writing comprehensive test suites
- Real-world skill (security-first testing)

## 🔍 How to Analyze Coverage

### Generate Coverage Report

```bash
cd backend

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov --cov-report=html

# Open HTML report
open htmlcov/index.html  # macOS
start htmlcov/index.html  # Windows
```

### Read Coverage Report

**Green lines:** Executed by tests ✅
**Red lines:** Never executed by tests ❌
**Yellow lines:** Partially executed ⚠️

### Focus On

1. **Critical paths** - Authentication, authorization
2. **Error handling** - Exception cases
3. **Edge cases** - Empty inputs, None values
4. **Business logic** - Core features

### Don't Worry About

1. **Trivial getters/setters** - Not worth testing
2. **Framework code** - Trust FastAPI works
3. \***\*repr** methods\*\* - Low value
4. **Impossible branches** - Defensive code

## 🎯 Recommended Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Gaps (Immediate) - **COMPLETED** ✅

Focus on untested functional code:

- ✅ Dev endpoints - test mode guards added + comprehensive test file created
- ✅ Error handling paths - significantly improved
- ✅ Authorization edge cases - much better coverage

**Goal:** 84.7% → 87.17% ✅ **ACHIEVED!**

### Phase 2: Edge Cases (Short Term)

Add edge case tests:

- Empty inputs
- Duplicate operations
- Invalid data

**Goal:** 87.17% → 90% (comprehensive)

### Phase 3: Comprehensive (Long Term)

Complete coverage:

- All branches
- All error paths
- All validations

**Goal:** 90% → 95% (excellent)
