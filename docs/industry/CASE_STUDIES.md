# Industry Case Studies: Real-World Testing Disasters and Successes

## Introduction

These case studies show the real-world impact of testing (or lack thereof) in major companies. Each story demonstrates key testing principles and their consequences in production systems.

## Unit Testing Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Knight Capital Group - The $440 Million Bug

**What Happened:**
In 2012, Knight Capital Group deployed code without proper unit testing. A single line of code change caused their trading system to lose $440 million in 45 minutes, nearly bankrupting the company.

**The Bug:**

```python
# Old code (working)
def process_order(order):
    if order.type == "buy":
        return buy_order(order)
    else:
        return sell_order(order)

# New code (broken) - missing 'else'
def process_order(order):
    if order.type == "buy":
        return buy_order(order)
    return sell_order(order)  # This always executes!
```

**What Unit Tests Would Have Caught:**

```python
def test_process_order_buy():
    order = Order(type="buy", amount=100)
    result = process_order(order)
    assert result.action == "buy"
    assert result.amount == 100

def test_process_order_sell():
    order = Order(type="sell", amount=100)
    result = process_order(order)
    assert result.action == "sell"
    assert result.amount == 100
```

**The Impact:**

- $440 million lost in 45 minutes
- Company nearly went bankrupt
- Stock price dropped 75%
- 1,500 employees lost their jobs

**Lesson Learned:**
Unit tests catch logic errors that seem trivial but have massive consequences. A simple missing `else` statement cost $440 million.

## Integration Testing Case Studies

### Case Study 3: E-commerce Platform Black Friday Outage

**What Happened:**
In 2018, a major e-commerce platform experienced a 2-hour outage during Black Friday, losing $100M in sales. The issue? Their unit tests all passed, but they missed that a database connection pool wasn't being properly initialized when the API server started.

**The Problem:**

```python
# Unit tests passed - individual functions worked
def create_user(email):
    return User(email=email)

def save_user(user):
    return db.save(user)

# Integration test would have caught this
def test_user_creation_flow():
    user = create_user("test@example.com")
    saved_user = save_user(user)
    assert saved_user.id is not None  # This failed!
```

**What Integration Tests Would Have Caught:**

```python
def test_user_creation_integration():
    # Test the complete flow
    response = client.post("/api/users", json={"email": "test@example.com"})
    assert response.status_code == 201

    # Verify user was actually saved
    user = db.query(User).filter(User.email == "test@example.com").first()
    assert user is not None
```

**The Impact:**

- 2-hour outage during peak shopping
- $100M in lost sales
- Customer trust damaged
- Stock price dropped 15%

**Lesson Learned:**
Unit tests ensure individual components work, but integration tests ensure they work together.

## E2E Testing Case Studies

### Case Study 5: Airline Booking System Bug

**What Happened:**
In 2019, a major airline's booking system had a critical bug that prevented customers from completing purchases. All unit tests passed, all integration tests passed, but when a real user tried to book a flight, the payment form had a JavaScript error that prevented submission.

**The Problem:**

```javascript
// Unit tests passed - individual functions worked
function validateForm() {
    return true;
}

function submitPayment() {
    return true;
}

// E2E test would have caught this
function test_booking_flow() {
    // User fills out form
    fillForm("John Doe", "john@example.com");

    // User clicks submit
    clickSubmit();

    // Payment should be processed
    assert paymentProcessed();  // This failed!
}
```

**What E2E Tests Would Have Caught:**

```javascript
test("complete booking flow", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/book-flight");
  await page.fill("#passenger-name", "John Doe");
  await page.fill("#email", "john@example.com");
  await page.click("#submit-booking");

  // This would have caught the JavaScript error
  await expect(page.locator("#success-message")).toBeVisible();
});
```

**The Impact:**

**The Problem:**

```javascript
// Performance test would have caught this
export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: "2m", target: 10000000 }, // 10M users
    { duration: "5m", target: 10000000 },
    { duration: "2m", target: 15000000 }, // 15M users - system breaks
  ],
};

export default function () {
  let response = http.get("https://platform.com/api/join-meeting");
  check(response, {
    "status is 200": (r) => r.status === 200,
    "response time < 500ms": (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
  });
}
```
