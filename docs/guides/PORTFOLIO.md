## üß™ Step 2: Add Your Own Contribution

**Don't just fork ‚Äî contribute something unique!**

### Option A: Add New Tests

Pick an area with lower coverage and add tests:

```python
# backend/tests/unit/test_my_contribution.py
"""
Additional test coverage for user profile validation.
Author: [Your Name]
Date: [Date]
"""

import pytest
from backend.models import User

class TestProfileValidation:
    """Tests I added to improve profile validation coverage."""

    def test_bio_max_length(self, db_session):
        """Verify bio cannot exceed 500 characters."""
        # Arrange
        user = User(
            email="test@example.com",
            username="testuser",
            bio="a" * 501  # Exceeds limit
        )

        # Act & Assert
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            db_session.add(user)
            db_session.commit()
```

### Option B: Improve Existing Tests

Refactor a test to be more readable or comprehensive:

```python
# Before (hypothetical)
def test_login():
    response = client.post("/auth/login", json=data)
    assert response.status_code == 200

# After (your improvement)
def test_login_success_complete_flow(client, test_user):
    """
    Comprehensive login test with full validation.
    Improvement by: [Your Name]
    """
    # Arrange
    credentials = {
        "email": test_user.email,
        "password": "TestPassword123!"
    }

    # Act
    response = client.post("/api/auth/login", json=credentials)

    # Assert
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert "access_token" in data
    assert data["token_type"] == "bearer"
    assert len(data["access_token"]) > 0
    # Verify token is JWT format
    assert data["access_token"].count(".") == 2
```

### Option C: Complete the Capstone Project

Do Stage 5 (Capstone) from `learn/stage_5_capstone/` and document it:

**Create `CAPSTONE.md` in your fork:**

## üó£Ô∏è Step 5: Interview Preparation

### Talking Points by Test Type

#### Unit Testing

**"Tell me about your experience with unit testing."**

> "In my Testbook project, I wrote 180+ backend unit tests using pytest. For example, I tested password hashing functions to ensure bcrypt was generating unique salts ‚Äî this is critical because reusing salts would make passwords vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. I used the AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) and pytest fixtures to keep tests clean and maintainable. One specific test I'm proud of validates that the same password generates different hashes each time, which caught a bug where we were accidentally using a static salt."

#### Integration Testing

**"How do you test APIs?"**

> "I use FastAPI's TestClient to test API endpoints in the Testbook project. For instance, I wrote integration tests for the user registration flow that verify not just the happy path, but also error cases like duplicate emails, weak passwords, and missing required fields. I check HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, 403), response schemas, and database state after operations. I also implemented contract testing using OpenAPI schemas to ensure the frontend and backend agree on API structure."

#### E2E Testing

**"What's your experience with end-to-end testing?"**

> "I've worked with Playwright in both Python and JavaScript stacks. In Testbook, I automated complete user journeys like registration ‚Üí login ‚Üí create post ‚Üí view feed. I use the Page Object Model to keep tests maintainable ‚Äî for example, I have a LoginPage class that encapsulates all login interactions, so if the UI changes, I only update one place. I've also debugged flaky E2E tests by adding proper waits, using data-testid attributes, and running tests in headed mode to understand what's happening visually."

#### Performance Testing

**"Have you done any performance testing?"**

> "Yes, using k6. In Testbook, I created load tests that simulate 100-1000 concurrent users hitting the API. I measure response times, throughput, and error rates under load. For example, I discovered that our feed endpoint was making N+1 database queries, causing response times to spike from 50ms to 500ms under load. This led to optimizing the queries with joins. I also do stress testing to find breaking points and spike testing to see how the system handles sudden traffic increases."

#### Security Testing

**"What do you know about security testing?"**

> "I've implemented tests covering the OWASP Top 10. In Testbook, I specifically test for SQL injection by sending malicious payloads and verifying they don't execute, XSS by checking that user input is properly escaped in HTML output, and CSRF by ensuring state-changing endpoints require valid tokens. I also verify rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks ‚Äî for example, ensuring login attempts are limited to 5 per minute per IP. These tests run in CI to catch security regressions before they hit production."

### Common Interview Questions

**Q: How do you decide what to test?**

> "I use the testing pyramid as a guide: lots of fast unit tests at the base, fewer integration tests in the middle, and minimal E2E tests at the top. I prioritize critical paths (authentication, payment, data integrity), edge cases that have caused bugs before, and complex business logic. I aim for around 80% coverage but focus on meaningful coverage ‚Äî not just hitting lines, but testing behaviors and outcomes users care about."

**Q: How do you handle flaky tests?**

> "First, I identify if it's truly flaky or if there's an underlying issue. Common causes are timing problems (fixed with proper waits), test interdependence (fixed by ensuring test isolation), or environment issues (fixed with proper setup/teardown). In Testbook, I use pytest fixtures to ensure clean state between tests and Playwright's auto-waiting to handle async operations. If a test is occasionally flaky, I don't ignore it ‚Äî flaky tests erode confidence in the suite."

**Q: What's the difference between a mock, a stub, and a fake?**

> "A mock is an object that records how it's called and asserts expectations (e.g., 'this method was called twice'). A stub returns predetermined responses but doesn't verify interactions. A fake is a working implementation with shortcuts (like an in-memory database instead of PostgreSQL). In Testbook, I use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for frontend tests, which acts like a fake server ‚Äî it's closer to real behavior than mocking fetch directly."

**Q: How do you test in a CI/CD pipeline?**

> "In Testbook, I set up GitHub Actions to run tests on every push and PR. The pipeline has separate jobs for backend tests, frontend tests, and E2E tests. E2E tests run after unit/integration tests pass to save time. I upload coverage reports as artifacts and use Codecov for tracking. Tests must pass before merging. This catches bugs early and gives confidence that main branch is always deployable."

## üé§ Step 7: Practice Your Pitch

### 30-Second Elevator Pitch

> "I recently completed a comprehensive automation testing project where I worked with 210+ tests across a full-stack application. I have experience with Python pytest for backend testing, JavaScript Vitest and Playwright for frontend and E2E testing, plus performance and security testing. I've set up CI/CD pipelines and achieved 86% code coverage. I'm excited to bring these skills to a QA engineering role and continue growing."

### 2-Minute Detailed Version

> "I'm transitioning into QA engineering and built my skills through Testbook, an open-source testing learning platform. Over [X weeks/months], I worked through a structured curriculum covering the entire testing pyramid.
>
> For unit testing, I wrote 180+ backend tests in Python using pytest, testing everything from password hashing to database models. I learned to use fixtures, parameterized tests, and mocking effectively.
>
> For integration testing, I tested FastAPI endpoints, validated HTTP responses, and implemented contract testing with OpenAPI schemas to prevent integration bugs between frontend and backend.
>
> For E2E testing, I used Playwright in both Python and JavaScript to automate complete user workflows. I implemented the Page Object Model pattern to keep tests maintainable.
>
> I also did performance testing with k6, simulating 1000+ concurrent users, and security testing covering OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
>
> Finally, I set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to run all tests automatically on every commit, with coverage reporting and artifact uploads.
>
> What I love about testing is the puzzle-solving aspect ‚Äî finding edge cases, reproducing bugs, and proving code works under various conditions. I'm ready to bring these skills to a professional QA team."
