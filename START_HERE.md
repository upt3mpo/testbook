## 🖥️ Platform Setup

### Option 1: DevContainer (One-Click Setup) ✨

**Recommended for VS Code users:**

1. Open project in VS Code
2. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for automatic setup
4. Start coding immediately!

**Benefits:** Pre-configured environment, all dependencies installed, works identically everywhere.

See **[DevContainer README](.devcontainer/README.md)** for details.

### Option 2: Task Runner (Simplified Commands) ✨

**After cloning the project:**

```bash
# Install task runner (one time)
brew install just  # macOS
# or use Make (already installed)

# Complete setup
make setup    # or: just setup

# Start development
make start    # or: just start
```

See **[Task Runner Guide](docs/guides/TASK_RUNNER.md)** for all commands.

### Option 3: Traditional Setup

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Use `start-dev.sh` (not `start.sh`) for learning!

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
cd Testbook
chmod +x *.sh
./start-dev.sh  # ← Use this for learning!
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
cd Testbook
start-dev.bat
```

**Verify:** Open **http://localhost:3000** - Testbook should load!

**📝 Why development mode?**
- All tests configured for port 3000
- No Docker required
- Easier for beginners
- See [WHICH_START_SCRIPT.md](WHICH_START_SCRIPT.md) for details
